# ComposeRecyclerView

**ComposeRecyclerView** enables seamless integration of Jetpack Compose composables within traditional RecyclerView. 
This library addresses performance concerns and resolves issues commonly faced in Compose LazyList implementations. 
It comes with built-in support for drag-and-drop functionality, making it a versatile solution for dynamic UIs.
